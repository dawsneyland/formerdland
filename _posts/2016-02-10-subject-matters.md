Post number one was short, post number two was rambling on about where to start, and now on to post number three. No more stalling! This is the stuff I want to cover in this Blog.

* *The Blog!* Ok, I'm cheating a bit, but as mentioned in the previous post, this is new to me and one of the things I'm interested in is starting a Blog and having an online presence, so periodically I will talk about how things are going.

* *Filmmaking.* Last year, I got a decent point-and-shoot camera which takes great pictures, but also beautiful video. Since then I've been making family videos centred around events, days out and holidays and not only do the family enjoy them, but I love making them and want to start making non-family videos. That will be a different beast altogether but definitely something I want to take on.

* *Photography.* Goes hand in hand with filmmaking really. Getting a half-decent camera has made me want to carry my camera everywhere. Not because I want to be an Instagram sensation, but because it makes me see things from a different perspective and slow down (something I'm bad at). For me, it's a bit like tennis - I'm really not great at it, but it doesn't stop me wanting to smack the ball so hard, it's never likely to land in the tram lines... actually it's not like tennis at all.

* *Stuff.* To be precise, tech stuff. To indulge in the pursuit of photography and filmmaking, there is a myriad of gear you can get. I'm not intending this to be a product review site, but if I've got something that I use and I like, I might discuss it in a bit more depth. I do not have endless funds, so when I get a piece of gear, it might not be the latest, or the best, but it has to be versatile and still be able to do the job well. Everyone knows the people with the best gear do not necessarily create the best things, and that sounds like a great challenge to me.

* *Creating.* I am not creative, but only recently have I decided that I will try to be anyway. Let's see what happens. It might be rubbish, but at least I'll be doing it.

* *Electronics-ish.* More specifically exploring what can be done with a Raspberry Pi, and maybe building a desktop computer or two. That kind of stuff. I've never really done it, but it can't be that hard, can it?

* *Old School (or is it Skool?!) Woodwork.* At least I think this is the heading I need. Some things I just want to try and make myself. For example, I need a poster frame in a non-standard size, and a bench for holding shoes. I'm no carpenter though, but as is the general theme of this post, who cares!

* *Bikes.* And exercise in general. I love bikes and would like to build one. I need to run more because once upon a time I was pretty good at it. So expect a  smidgen of that.

* *Family.* It's inevitable that I'll include stuff about my family. They're the people I love and I want to spend time with. They support me when I want to do things, and will almost certainly help me achieve some of the things I've mentioned above.

I think that's enough to start with. See what I mean about this Blog being a little unfocused? I may never touch on some of the topics above, but I just don't know what I'm going to do yet, so best to get it all on the table.

I suppose I'd better start now. Gulp!
