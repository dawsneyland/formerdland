My last post, the first of this Blog, was short and not that sweet. Functional and a line in the sand to say 'Hi, I've posted something to something' and the reason is encapsulated in that comment there. I wanted to say something on something but wasn't sure what either of those things were or what they were going to look like.

My only brief to myself regarding this Blog is 'start something to organise your thoughts and explore the things you enjoy and are interested in'. There is no organisation of my ideas yet or any focus of this blog-stroke-site. But knowing myself, I think about lots of things and never do them, so in an effort to change my ways, I just dived straight in, without too much of a thought for the future because if I do think of that, in all likelihood I'd never do anything.

It sounds quite slapdash (and it is) but I figure this will evolve over time and it will find its place and its voice. I can't write for toffee but I'll never learn whilst I don't try.

So what have I been doing in the week since I posted last? Well, in short, I've been fighting to stop this going the way of everything else I try my hand at, in other words abandoned.

I decided I wanted to come up with a smart looking website, however there are a number of things in my way. Firstly, I haven't done that before. In fact, I've never designed anything very well, and have never written a website.

I know what you're now thinking; just log in to WordPress, chose a theme and crack on. True, I but this site is meant to be about things I am interested in and want to explore, and I have been interested in web design for ages but lacked a project to act as a vehicle for this. I've created a WordPress site before and could do that but one of my character traits kicks in. Unfortunately, I want to be amazing at everything as soon as I start learning. Ridiculous, but crippling. It means I abandon most things and berate myself for being useless. That feels pretty awful. So this week I've been on journey. I've thought, let's write something amazing from scratch. I'm pretty good at computer coding and despite not writing any sites before, I've found it easy to pick up the basics and get a base out there. But I'm not a designer and am not going to be one anytime soon, and this has been a battle. I've enjoyed the coding so much I've thought about doing this professionally and so put pressure on myself to be brilliant at designing, and add such I've had no ideas about this site. A reality check after a few days of research led me to a conclusion. I don't have to do it professionally, and it doesn't have to be perfect straight away. Just do something and build on it, so that's what I'm trying to do.

The other problem with coming up with a smart looking website is that I've got no content. And I don't even know what that content is going to be. Purely words? Perhaps some videos too? Is it a diary, out a magazine style? And then I had an epiphany. Let's say I was doing this professionally and approaching it from a structured perspective, I would ask a client what they ultimately wanted, a solid brief,  a distinct direction. So how can I come up with the perfect website if as a designer I don't know the precise brief and as my own client, I have no direction? Exactly!

It can't be perfect whilst there are so many unknowns. So I'll carry on doing and learning and maybe cutting myself a bit of slack, after all just a week ago if never written in HTML or CSS, so I think I'm doing alright.

A small point too. I haven't given anyone the website address yet, no one really knows I'm doing this, so it's not like I have an audience waiting with anticipation.

Ok... Next , what to write about!!
