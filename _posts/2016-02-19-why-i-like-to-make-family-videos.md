Last week I was away for a long weekend with my family, and as has become the norm in the last year, I took lots of video of my son and his cousins. Now I’m back from the weekend, it’s time to do what I normally do; import all of the footage, edit the best bits against a backdrop of one of my favourite songs whose lyrics are acceptable for all of my family, upload it to YouTube and let everyone know how to access it. I upload it to YouTube as unlisted, because it's for the eyes of the family only, and to be honest they're the only people likely to be interested anyway.

I love doing this. Why? For a start, it’s just a different way to document a family event, or a day out. Photos are great and I still enjoy taking them too and printing the best ones to put up around the house or share with the family, but video gives something different, something powerful, in a way that photos can’t. Movement. I know it sounds obvious to suggest that videos move more than photos, and everyone knows that, but with that movement comes a different experience, capturing different things.

I've learned that capturing the video is only one aspect of making the films. I never expected to enjoy the process, but that is such a crucial part of the end result and if you're happy with the final film, then the post production process will have had an awful lot to do with it. Even though it’s pretty basic and I don’t have advanced software, tools or equipment, I am in full control of how to put the video together, which clips to use, what kind of mood I want to set. My only limitation is my own ability to capture the shots I want, and the lack of the tools with all the bells and whistles make it more challenging too.

Another reason I enjoy doing this is the reaction it gets from my family. They are genuinely moved by the videos, and I’m starting to think they’d be disappointed if I didn’t make them – although it’s quite possible I’m mistaken. This is relatively new to them as an alternative method of capturing a memory, but it’s certainly something they are open to and don’t mind me pointing a camera at them or their offspring for minutes at a time when we’re all trying to enjoy an occasion. 

It does my mental health the world of good when I've made a film and distributed it to the handful of people who will be interested it.

Although I’d like to think that my close family enjoy these videos because I’m a talented filmmaker, the reality is that this end result is straight forward to achieve. For a start, I’m filming things they will want to see… their children, their Nephews and Nieces. I discard all the naff stuff and keep the good content. Also, I don’t have to provide any dialogue. I just chose a song to set the tone and let it play as the background track from start to finish, fitting all the clips in during that time. I'm basically shooting a music video. And lastly, the easiest thing for me is that I am always behind the camera so never have to be the subject which is just as well as I hate to see or hear myself in any media. I just have to try and take the time to capture a variety of footage with a camera that will pretty much do the job automatically as long as I point it in the right direction. Ok, maybe I’m being a little hard on myself, but you get the idea.

The thing is, I want to get better, and I don’t always want to have to wait for a family holiday or birthday to make something. So I need to remove these comfort blankets, move to be in front of the camera, and address my dislike of my own voice and appearance. I want to make something that people whom I’ve never met, may want to watch. For me, that’s pretty terrifying, but challenging. I’m not saying I want to make a feature film, or have a ‘crew’, but I think I'd like to make some simple films by myself.

The reason I started watching videos online was because after my father died, I remembered that he had performed on a TV show as part of a choir he sang in. He was prominently placed in the front row of the choir, so was visible most of the time. I desperately wanted to see my Dad moving rather than just smiling in a photo, so I turned to YouTube; surely someone had uploaded this show? They had. And this helped me tremendously. And it got me sold on the essence of YouTube.

As time has gone on I’ve watched more videos about people I don’t know, and it has only proved to demonstrate what a powerful medium this is. It’s not just prank videos, silly singing, or cats doing the funniest things. I've gradually moved through watching music videos, tutorials, reviews, geeky channels about numbers, comedy sketches, short films, vlogs - the list goes on.

Additionally if you’ve got any kind of camera or smartphone and a computer, you can make films yourself. So that’s what I did, starting with a family video filmed entirely on my Samsung Galaxy S4. Then I bought a cheap point-and-shoot camera and filmed some more family videos. Next I might try to do something non-family, not because I want an audience, just because I enjoy trying to make something and challenge myself. And one day someone who loves me might want to see me move, just once more.
