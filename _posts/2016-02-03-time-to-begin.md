It’s time. I have decided that I'd like to start a blog and have finally got around to doing it. It's pretty basic though so, should still fit in to the category of 'fun hobby' rather than the category of 'this takes up so much time, I wish I had never started the f-ing thing'.

I’m using something called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build this from scratch, as opposed to popular blogging tools. Why? I suppose I think it'll be fun, and it's also an excuse to do some coding - something I very much enjoy, but very rarely get the opportunity to do these days. To code, you need a project and a personal blog is a nice little project that will give me the opportunity to build something that needs maintaining, and can also be overhauled at some point in the future.

Ok, so what do I want to say? Not sure to be honest. There are things that interest me, and I'm going to make the assumption that they interest other people, because they are pretty conventional. I love reading about and watching what other people have done, so it's not too much of a leap to think that other people might be interested in things I have done, or would like to do.

This is a personal project. I'm not trying to build a brand, or get an audience, but if you think that someone would be interested in or would like something I've done then share it. Or not. It doesn't matter. I just want to stop thinking about doing things, and start doing thoses things.

I’m learning, and whilst I’m trying to get this thing going, I will make this first post short. I’ll take more time in the next post to explain what Dawsneyland is and where it is going.

Until next time...
