I am Martin. Let me tell you a little bit about Dawsneyland.

Dawsneyland is the place that has existed for a while now, but only for me as it is essentially in my head. 

It's the place I live, the life I lead, the things I do, the people I love and the struggles I face. Starting this blog is an effort to organise the mish-mash of thoughts I have and share them with whoever feels they would like to read them. It's not always the most interesting place in the world, so I'll be selective, and hopefully make it interesting to read.

On social media, I can be found here:
