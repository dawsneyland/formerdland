<p>Projects… projects… tricky!</p>

<p>I think I know what I want to put on this page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Things I’m planning on doing</li>
  <li>Works in progress</li>
  <li>(ahem) successful stories about what I’ve achieved</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the plan but whilst this site is in its infancy, there are nothing but good intentions to put here.</p>

<p>I know! I’ll use social media to say when things change.</p>
